# Feature importance

In order to evaluate the importance of the different features we use a feature importance plot. Just to see that we already gain a lot of interpretability, we look at the importance of the features in the original model with Claim index as a feature.

## Old model

We can see that using Claim index as a feature, it is by far the most important. Hence we can expect to lose a lot of predictive strength when we don't include it as a feature. 
```{r}
importance1<-readRDS("random_forest_imp")
plot(importance1)
```

## Sequential model
In this model claim index is unimportant since it is not included in the prediction, but still technically included as a feature.
```{r}
importance2<- readRDS("sev_freq_rforest_imp")
plot(importance2)
```
There is a lot of agreement between the two models in terms of which features are the most important.
